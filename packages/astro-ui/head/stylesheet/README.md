# Astro Stylesheet Component

A simple component to help abstract the monotony of adding stylesheets to any Astro project.

To use simply:

```bash
npm i astro-ui-stylesheet -D
```

Within your `./src/layouts/*.astro` layout file, apply the following:

```astro
---
import Stylesheet from 'astro-ui-stylesheet'

export type SanitizeList =
        "all" |
        "bare"|
        "forms"|
        "assets"|
        "typography"|
        "reducedMotion"|
        "sysUI"|
        "monoUI"
    
export interface Props{
    attributes: linkAttributes[]
    sanitize?:SanitizeList
}
export declare type linkAttributes = {
    href: "npm:" | string,
    media?:string
}
---
<html>
  <head>
    <Stylesheet 
        attributes: Array<Object> = {
          [
            {
              href:string = "./styles/global.css" || Astro.resolve('./src/components/x.css'), || "npm:bootstrap@next/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
              media:string = "screen and (max-width:600px)"
            }
          ]
        }
        sanitize:string =  "all" | "bare"| "forms"| "assets"| "typography"|
                            "reducedMotion"| "sysUI"| "monoUI"
    />
 </head>
</html>

```

This would then populate all the relevant `<link rel='stylesheet' href='' type='text/css' media=''>` required in the head of the Layout file.

## Props.attributes `:linkAttributes[]`

The Props `attributes` is a JSX array of objects as represented by the type `linkAttributes`

```ts
export declare type linkAttributes = {
    href: "npm:" | string,
    media?:string
}
```

### `href:string`

Within the object, the `href` attribute, captures the hyperlink reference to the css file, this could be stored within the `public` directory i.e:`./public/styles.css` and referenced as `./styles.css`. You could also use `Astro.resolve()` to resolve files located within the `./src/*` directory.

The `href` also allows you to link to any `https://` or CDN to obtain you css file.

> ❗ All Files must be a `type='text/css'` file ending in `*.css`

The `href` can also source css files located within npm packages. By utilising [Skypack](https://www.skypack.dev/) to obtain the css files you can access stylesheets from other css frameworks to name but a few:

- [Bootstrap](https://www.skypack.dev/view/bootstrap) `npm:bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`
- [Bulma](https://www.skypack.dev/view/bulma) `npm:bulma/css/bulma.css`
- [SakuraCSS](https://www.skypack.dev/view/sakura.css) `npm:sakuraCss/sakura.css`

**⚠️ Caution**

This only works for addresses that route directly to a stylesheet, if your desired framework requires additional `<script>` tags to work, then this would not be supportive of your endeavours, sorry.

### `media?:string`

This media directive allows for stylesheets that are media query specific to be applied with this `<Stylesheet>` ComponentAPI. 

Using the same syntax as one normally would to direct such things. For further information see [MDN Stylesheet.media](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/StyleSheet/media)

## Sanitize.css

The `<Stylesheet>` component is tightly coupled with the [`sanitizer.css`](https://csstools.github.io/sanitize.css/) project. This project alongside its sister project [`normalize.css`](https://github.com/csstools/normalize.css), helps to provide a consistent cross-browser CSS library. Helping to give developers a default styling experience.

To utilize Sanitize.css with this component, simply designate which of the Sanitize.css packages you wish to add to your site.

```ts
type SanitizeList =
        "all" |
        "bare"|
        "forms"|
        "assets"|
        "typography"|
        "reducedMotion"|
        "sysUI"|
        "monoUI"

```

This project is firmly of the back of this great project. Please look to support the projects by giving them a star on github, it would really mean the world to them.
